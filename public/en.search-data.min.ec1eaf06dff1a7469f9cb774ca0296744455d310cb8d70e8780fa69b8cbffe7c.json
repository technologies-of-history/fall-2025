All of our readings are available online, either via the Firestone library’s digital subscriptions or via our course Canvas.\nEvaluation \u0026amp; Grading # Attendance and completion of pre-lab assignments, including posting to our course Canvas discussion board, is mandatory. Grades will be awarded according to History Department criteria, reproduced at the end of the syllabus. More than two absences from class sessions without contacting the instructor and providing explanation (and documentation of illness, when necessary) will result in 5 point reduction from your final grade for every class period missed.\nParticipation # Participation is a critical component of this course. Students are expected to come to class having done the reading and ready to engage in class discussion. Engagement includes both active listening to your fellow students’ viewpoints and careful articulation of your own ideas. If you tend to be a talker, please share your thoughts but be sure to make room for others. If you tend to be quiet, know that your voice is essential in our classroom. You will always show respect for your fellow students, even when you disagree with their ideas.\nLate Work # Ten points will be deducted from the final grade of an assignment for every day the assignment is late. Assignments more than three days late will not be accepted. If you have an emergency or extenuating circumstance that may prevent you from completing your work on time, you should be sure to communicate these concerns with me well in advance of the assignment’s due date.\nHonor Code # All student work should meet the requirements of the University’s Honor Code, and all papers will include the honor pledge on the title page, signed by the student.\nAccommodations for Disabilities # Students must register with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) (ods@princeton.edu; 258-8840) for disability verification and determination of eligibility for reasonable academic accommodations. Requests for academic accommodations for this course need to be made at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as possible for newly approved students, and again at least two weeks in advance of any needed accommodations in order to make arrangements to implement the accommodations. Please make an appointment to meet with me in order to maintain confidentiality in addressing your needs. No accommodations will be given without authorization from ODS, or without advance notice.\nDepartment of History Grading Policy # Participation # A student who receives an A for participation in discussion in precepts or seminars typically comes to every class with questions about the readings in mind. An ‘A’ discussant engages others about ideas, respects the opinions of others, and consistently elevates the level of discussion.\nA student who receives a B for participation in discussion in precepts or seminars typically does not always come to class with questions about the readings in mind. A ‘B’ discussant waits passively for others to raise interesting issues. Some discussants in this category, while courteous and articulate, do not adequately listen to other participants or relate their comments to the direction of the conversation.\nA student who receives a C for discussion in precepts or seminars attends regularly but typically is an infrequent or unwilling participant in discussion.\nA student who fails to attend precepts regularly or to adequately prepare for discussion risks the grade of D or F.\nPapers # An A or A- thesis, paper, or exam is one that is good enough to be read aloud in a class. It is clearly written and well-organized. It demonstrates that the writer has conducted a close and critical reading of texts, grappled with the issues raised in the course, synthesized the readings, discussions, and lectures, and formulated a perceptive, compelling, independent argument. The argument shows intellectual originality and creativity, is sensitive to historical context, is supported by a well-chosen variety of specific examples, and, in the case of a research paper, is built on a critical reading of primary material.\nA B+ or B thesis, paper, or exam demonstrates many aspects of A-level work but falls short of it in either the organization and clarity of its writing, the formulation and presentation of its argument, or the quality of research. Some papers or exams in this category are solid works containing flashes of insight into many of the issues raised in the course. Others give evidence of independent thought, but the argument is not presented clearly or convincingly.\nA B- thesis, paper, or exam demonstrates a command of course or research material and understanding of historical context but provides a less than thorough defense of the writer\u0026rsquo;s independent argument because of weaknesses in writing, argument, organization, or use of evidence.\nA C+, C, or C- thesis, paper, or exam offers little more than a mere a summary of ideas and information covered in the course, is insensitive to historical context, does not respond to the assignment adequately, suffers from frequent factual errors, unclear writing, poor organization, or inadequate primary research, or presents some combination of these problems.\nWhereas the grading standards for written work between A and C- are concerned with the presentation of argument and evidence, a paper or exam that belongs to the D or F categories demonstrates inadequate command of course material.\nA D thesis, paper, or exam demonstrates serious deficiencies or severe flaws in the student\u0026rsquo;s command of course or research material.\nAn F thesis, paper, or exam demonstrates no competence in the course or research materials. It indicates a student’s neglect or lack of effort in the course.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/assignments/digitaltools1/","title":"Digital Tools 1","section":"Assignments","content":" Communicating Simply with Markdown, Hugo, and GitHub # By now you\u0026rsquo;ve created a GitHub account, practiced opening a repository, making changes to a file, making a pull request, and merging branches with GitHub\u0026rsquo;s Hello World tutorial. You\u0026rsquo;ve followed the Markdown lesson on the Programming Historian, so you know how to style your text files with Markdown syntax. We\u0026rsquo;ve practiced authoring Markdown files in class, but now it\u0026rsquo;s time to do it on your own and create content for our course blog. You\u0026rsquo;ll be following these same steps to create and submit the rest of your Digital Tools assignments, so it\u0026rsquo;s very important for you to get the hang of these basic steps now.\nStep 1: Think about downloading a text editor # All of your digital assignments this semester will be authored in Markdown, which means you can\u0026rsquo;t use Google Docs or Microsoft word to create them. As you know, you can always create Markdown files (.md) directly in GitHub, but if you\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to complete your assignments offline, save your work on your own machine, and preview your work in a local development environment on Hugo, then you will want to use a text editing program to write and save your .md files. If you\u0026rsquo;ve done some programming/coding before, you likely already have a favorite text editor, and you should keep using it. If not, I really like BBEdit for MacOS and Notepad++ for Windows. Both provide nice features in their \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; mode, and don\u0026rsquo;t require a subscription.\nStep 2: Take a look at an existing post # Open the class repository that you\u0026rsquo;ve forked into your personal GitHub account. Find the posts folder and open it. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a single file in there titled 2020-11-15-Welcome to Technologies of History.md. This is the Markdown file for the blog post that appears on the homepage of our course website. Note the file naming conventions. All of the blog posts created for our site must be named in the same way: yyyy-mm-dd-your title.md.\nClick the name of the file to open it, and then click on the pencil icon in the upper right to edit the file. You should now see the post written in Markdown with a header at the top that looks like this:\n--- layout: post author: Melissa Reynolds bookTOC: false draft: false title: Welcome to Technologies of History --- Note the formatting of this file. The heading at the top is very important. Every post that you write for our course site must include this same header, though of course you\u0026rsquo;ll change whatever comes after the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; field to your chosen title. Without the header, Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t know to turn your Markdown file into a webpage.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what this header is telling Hugo:\nlayout: post This is a post, not a static webpage, and should display with author and date information and be sorted on the homepage with most recent at the top.\nauthor: Melissa Reynolds Hugo knows to include this name as the author in the metadata and header of this post.\nbookTOC: false The template we\u0026rsquo;re using in this class has an option to include a left-hand menu that is automatically populated with the any header text. I\u0026rsquo;ve opted to switch this off, but if you want it, change the code to read bookTOC: true\ndraft: false This tells Hugo that this post is no longer a draft and is ready to be served to the website. The absence of this piece of code or draft: true tells Hugo that the post isn\u0026rsquo;t ready to go live yet.\ntitle: Your Title Here This one is pretty self explanatory!\nStep 5: Write a new post in Markdown # Now complete your assignment: write a 2–3 paragraph post reflecting on the relationship between the nature or format of a communication technology and the kind of knowledge that technology can produce. Historians have suggested, for example, that alphabetic writing enabled the development of philosophical thought in Greece that was markedly different from that of ancient Mesopotamia, with its cuneiform syllabary. In what ways do we see a similar relationship between the principles of static computing and the production of digital scholarship? Are historians arguments constrained or shaped by the tools they use to tell them?\n(Note: the following instructions are for those of you brand new to GitHub, who don\u0026rsquo;t use GitHub desktop or a text editor. This is the most basic way to add a file to your repository, but if you already know how to push changes and commit via those other platforms, go right ahead.)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re writing directly in GitHub:\nCreate a New Branch in our course repository. Click the arrow to the right of master in the branch menu, and in the search box type in the name of the new branch you\u0026rsquo;ll create: lastname-dt1. Click the option that appears that says Create branch: lastname-dt1. Open the posts folder of that new branch. Click Create New File and create a new Markdown file with the appropriate naming conventions: yyyy-mm-dd-your title.md. ALL posts you create for this course blog must follow these exact naming conventions. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing your posts in a text editor:\nOpen your text editor of choice and create a new reate a new Markdown file with the appropriate naming conventions: yyyy-mm-dd-your title.md. Step 6: Commit your post # If you\u0026rsquo;re writing directly in GitHub:\nClick the green Commit button to save the post to your repository. If you\u0026rsquo;re writing your posts in a text editor:\nCreate a New Branch in our course repository.\nClick the arrow to the right of master in the branch menu, and in the search box type in the name of the new branch you\u0026rsquo;ll create: lastname-dt1.\nClick the option that appears that says Create branch: yourname-dt1.\nNavigate to the posts folder and click Add File and then Upload Files and either drag and drop or select your Markdown file to upload.\nThen Commit that file to your repository as you would one authored directly in GitHub.\nUpload your post into the _posts folder of the new branch.\nCommit your changes, and create a Pull Request to merge it with the master branch of our repository. Pay attention and be sure you select the right head for your request.\nStep 7: Create a pull request # You\u0026rsquo;ve written your post and committed it to your posts folder in your personal repository. Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time to notify the developer (me) that you\u0026rsquo;d like the post to be merged into the main branch of the site so that it can be served to the website.\nIn the menu at the top of your repository, click Pull requests. Click the green button New pull request. You\u0026rsquo;ll now see a gray box at the top that shows you the base repository you\u0026rsquo;ll be sending your changes to (digital-history/digital-history.github.io), and the head repository, which is yours (digital-history/lastname-dt1). NOTE: Be sure that yours is the head and the main branch is the base. Name your pull request LastName_dt1 and then click Create pull request. Ok, that\u0026rsquo;s it! You\u0026rsquo;ve written a blog post in Markdown and followed the standard GitHub workflow to send it to our class site. Pat yourself on the back, and know that you\u0026rsquo;ll do it all over again for the next three assignments.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/2024-11-04-welcome-to-our-course/","title":"Welcome to our course!","section":"Student Work","content":"This is a test post to see how posts are rendered on the course blog.\n"}]
